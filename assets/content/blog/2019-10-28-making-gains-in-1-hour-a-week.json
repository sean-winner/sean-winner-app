  "body": "For the past 4 months, I've been practicing a simplified fitness practice influenced by Philip and Martina Chubb of [@the_mindful_mover](https://www.instagram.com/the_mindful_mover)_._ I strength and sprint train with 3 days of rest in between. i.e. I strength train Monday, rest for 3 days, sprint train Thursday, rest for 3 days, strength train Tuesday, and so on.. My strength training takes about 45 - 50 minutes and sprints take about 15 minutes. So, I spend about an hour a week on training. My rest days consist of long slow walks, sun exposure, and meditation. This approach has given me gains in my strength and cardio while freeing up a considerable amount of time.\n\nMy strength training consists of 5 main movements that I train past failure (once I fail I perform negatives). The 5 main movements cover legs, horizontal pushing/pulling, and vertical pushing/pulling. Full ROM squats, planche push-ups, one arm chin-ups, handstand push-ups, and front lever rows. For each movement, there is a progression, so if you can't do a one-arm chin-up you do switch grip chin-ups (shifting as much weight as you can to one arm) until you can progress toward a full one-arm chin-up. These movements combine strength with mobility replacing the need for daily mobility/stretching sessions. \n\n<div>\n  <iframe\n    src=\"https://instagram.com/p/B2cUh6fnwxb/embed\"\n    frameborder=\"0\"\n    allowfullscreen\n    scrolling=\"no\"\n    allowtransparency\n  ></iframe>\n</div>\n\nSprint training consists of 3 death sprints (sprint till you can't sprint) with ample rest time between each. I'm completely gassed after 3 of these and my heart rate is through the roof.\n\nThe main idea is to go to the extremes and push the body to the brink of what it can handle. Train to the extreme then rest to the extreme. Doing no chronic cardio and taking long slow walks with my dog or whoever wants to join. I try to spend time in nature decompressing and make time every day to just do nothing (no phone no books just doing nothing and letting thoughts come and go). Also, making sure I get as much sunlight as I can. After 3 days of rest, I'm ready to take on the next extreme training session.\n\nI've been able to make consistent gains using this approach. My full ROM squat PR has gone from 230 lbs to 265 lbs over the last 4 months and my bodyweight movements have been progressing consistently. Is it the quickest approach to gaining strength/cardio? I don't know and don't care to know. The fact that I can make consistent gains while strength training once every 8 days and spending a total of 1 hour a week on training is more valuable to me. I have more time to do other things I'm interested in like reading, coding, thinking, meeting up with like-minded people, maximizing my exposure to random opportunities, and doing whatever I want to do. Not to mention traveling in a van is much easier when you only need to make it to the gym once every 8 days. I find that I'm not fighting for time to get things done. I just have it and I don't feel like I'm missing out on my fitness by not making it to the gym every day.\n\nThe next step for me is to hire Philip and Martina to coach me. They offer online coaching, but also give away an insane amount of info and results from their experiments for free on their Instagram. So check them out if you find any of this interesting."
